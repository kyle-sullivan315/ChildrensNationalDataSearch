# ChildrensNationalDataSearch

For this project, I had two sheets with anonymous patient information. Sheet one had an identifying number, date of birth, age, test date, and three different test scores. Sheet 2 had just the identifying numbers, age, and test date. I used the dataSearch subroutine to find each of the indetifying numbers from sheet 2 in sheet 1. If the ID numbers matched, I had to confirm the ages are the same and that the test date was the same, and once that was confirmed, the test scores for that patient were copied from sheet 1 to sheet 2.
